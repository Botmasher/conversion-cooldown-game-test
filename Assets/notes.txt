Conversion-Cooldown Influence Sim

Description

A bare-bones game to experiment with proposed mechanics for a conversion sim: influence bar, influence abilities, ability cooldown. These notes are for general pre-GDD ideas before and during experimentation.

Details

Work on these variations is being carried out as part of the slow and ongoing progress towards a more general project with the working title "Unto Me". This interactive sketch will use scripted behaviors and prefabs to set up the following situation:
- two competing players (A and B for our purposes)
- total point count per player
- an influence bar between A and B
  - marker to current value along bar (initially midpoint)
  - mapping of space to values (-1.0 <= marker <= 1.0)
  - association of values to player favor (A at -1, B at 1)
  - bar increasingly favors player (points per unit time) towards bar limits
- player locations (bases) on the ground
- target area to influence (target) on the ground
- influence actions
  - player can send out a unit to influence target
  - player can use an ability
    ?- player can build some sort of upgrade
    ?- player can use some sort of ability
  - actions have cooldown time
    ?- all actions must cooldown when one used (at least initially)
  - player has one special ability
    - counted up over time, with rate increasing for certain actions
    - balance, like maybe increasingly diminishing one player increases their accrual rate
- set up and tweak the way actions contribute to influence bar
  - is the general play ever interesting, and why (not)?
  - which adjustments make play more or less engaging, and why?
- extras
  - player obtains resources from influencing
    - start with
    - bar marker points, even if less than current influence (incentivize risk)?
    - eventually can add actions
